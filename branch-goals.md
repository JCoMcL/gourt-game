#Stack placement
Allow placing a stack of gourts in the editor.
#Player ownership
Move away from a system where every gourt decides for themselves whether to listen to player input. The Player should command gourts. Gourts should also have a means to transfer control to something else
# Gourt Sense
rework gourt senses, perhaps with raycast shapes that serve specific purposes. Offload some code to the sensor suite. Make it general-purpose, NPCs should have a sensor suite too.
